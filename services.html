            <p>
                Do you have a raw idea that needs engineering? A requirement for a part or a tool that needs design? A physical prototype in metal or plastic that needs to be replicated? Need to formalize existing design into drawings, ready for a machinist to do CNC Machining? From brainstorming to the final design, drawings and machined part - we do it all!
                <br>
                <br> Customers often come to us with metal or plastic parts for CNC Machining but they only have a physical sample that needs reverse engineering. We do it well. From precise measurements to solid models, to engineering how it should work to improving the design and to making formal drawings. And then of course CNC Machining for the parts that we designed.
                <br>
                <br> It is also often when customers come to us with just an idea and we do all the rest.
                <br>
                <br> We do CNC Machining in large volumes as well as
                <b>one-offs
